The 3 source files are: mlgps.c, mlgps_mlcb.c, modifiedGS.c

Each file has by default OMP_PTHREADS set to 1 meaning it'll compile to run with OpenMP parallelism. That can be switched to 0 to use pthreads instead.

mlgps.c: Multilevel Graph Partition Implementation, including the solver. 

mlgps_mlcb.c file has just coarsening and bisection and is there on profile for weak scaling.

modifiedGS.c: Modified naive iterative Gauss Seidel solver

nycgraph.gr: Newyork city road network graph.

Usage: 

./MLGPS <graph> <#threads> 1000

./MLGPS_MLCB <graph> <#threads> 1000 <#parts>

./MGS <graph> <#threads>
